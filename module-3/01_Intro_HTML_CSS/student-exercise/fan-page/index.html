            <h3>Movie info</h3>
            <p>A Fred Hampton biopic had been in the works for several years, with both the Lucas brothers and Will Berson writing and shopping screenplays individually since 2014. Berson's version almost got made with F. Gary Gray directing, but, when that fell through, King was hired to helm the project. The cast joined in 2019, with the blessings of Hampton's family, with filming taking place that fall in Ohio.
